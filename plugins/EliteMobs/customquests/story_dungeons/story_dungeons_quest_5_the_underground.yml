name: '&2The Underground!'
questLore:
- With the guardian gone our scouts were able to go ahead and gather some valuable information.
- The city is ancient, way older than you, me and this guild. 
- A dwarven city, seems like they settled there a long time ago and were mining in the area.
- Our scouts have sighted some of the dwarves, but something is wrong.
- They are just shambling about, but they do not appear undead either.
- We are not sure what is going on. There is a palace at the end of the city, go down there and clear the way to the palace so our guild can examine the city in more detail.

- '&7&oAn underground city, should be interesting.'
questCompleteMessage:
- '&e[Wallitz]&f Our forty-seventh-best guild member returns! I hear from our scouts that the dwarves were completely gone mentally. I wonder if their greed led them to some horrible fate?'
- '&7&oI should speak to &e&oWallitz&7&o when I am ready to continue.'
