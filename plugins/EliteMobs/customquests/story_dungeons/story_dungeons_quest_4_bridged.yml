questLore:
- Ah, just in time. So, we looked at the remains of that weaver creature that was down in the mines.
- We are certain that it is a Nether being. How it made its way up here, I have no clue.
- We had managed to open the gate that was blocking the way into that underground city you mentioned.
- You need to go there and see what you can uncover...
- Oh, right! There is a guardian blocking the way into the city, and it doesn’t look friendly so you will need to deal with that first.
